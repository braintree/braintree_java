# Braintree Java library

The Braintree Java library provides integration access to the Braintree Gateway.

## Please Note
> **The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Council has [mandated](https://blog.pcisecuritystandards.org/migrating-from-ssl-and-early-tls) that early versions of TLS be retired from service.  All organizations that handle credit card information are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, Braintree is updating its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections. Braintree will also require HTTP/1.1 for all connections. Please see our [technical documentation](https://github.com/paypal/tls-update) for more information.**

## Dependencies

* none

Java version >= 8 is required. The Braintree Java SDK is tested against Java versions 8 and 11.

## Versions
> :warning: **The SSL certificates for Java SDK versions older than 2.75.0 are set to expire by March 30, 2026. If you do not update your SDK to the latest version with the updated certificates by March 30, 2026, 100% of your impacted traffic will fail**

Braintree employs a deprecation policy for our SDKs. For more information on the statuses of an SDK check our [developer docs](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/reference/general/server-sdk-deprecation-policy).

## Quick Start Example

````java
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import com.braintreegateway.*;

public class BraintreeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BraintreeGateway gateway = new BraintreeGateway(
            Environment.SANDBOX,
            "the_merchant_id",
            "the_public_key",
            "the_private_key"
        );

        TransactionRequest request = new TransactionRequest()
            .amount(new BigDecimal("1000.00"))
            .paymentMethodNonce(nonceFromTheClient)
            .options()
                .submitForSettlement(true)
                .done();

        Result<Transaction> result = gateway.transaction().sale(request);

        if (result.isSuccess()) {
            Transaction transaction = result.getTarget();
            System.out.println("Success!: " + transaction.getId());
        } else if (result.getTransaction() != null) {
            Transaction transaction = result.getTransaction();
            System.out.println("Error processing transaction:");
            System.out.println("  Status: " + transaction.getStatus());
            System.out.println("  Code: " + transaction.getProcessorResponseCode());
            System.out.println("  Text: " + transaction.getProcessorResponseText());
        } else {
            for (ValidationError error : result.getErrors().getAllDeepValidationErrors()) {
               System.out.println("Attribute: " + error.getAttribute());
               System.out.println("  Code: " + error.getCode());
               System.out.println("  Message: " + error.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
